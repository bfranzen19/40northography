    <h3 class="h3header">what is this?</h3>
    <p class="pText">
      i've been planning this trip for years, really focusing on making it happen for the past year. my father, skip, died march 1st of this year and this is my way of grieving. seeing the world and living a life he would enjoy is helping me through all of this. as a <a href='https://btfranzen.com'>web developer</a>, this trip is giving me an opportunity to hone my skills and create an application that allows everyone to follow along with our trip as much or as little as they would please without having membership to multiple social media platforms (although i'll be updating those as well). as a photographer, this trip gives me an opportunity to see beautiful things and new places. as a cartographer, it gives me an opportunity to use different mapping and gps technologies to make some accompanying visualizations for everyone. as a person, it allows me to heal and find my way in this world without my dad.
